### About me

I'm a data-driven problem solver with 8 years of experience in marketing and growth strategy, now focused on using SQL, Python, and data visualization to drive smarter business decisions.

### What I Do

I'm transitioning into **data and product analytics roles**, building on my background in marketing strategy, campaign performance analysis, and customer insights. I’ve led initiatives at companies like Amazon, AAA, and ThredUp that generated measurable business impact — from automating reporting pipelines to uncovering trends that boosted ROI.

My sweet spot: using **data to explain what’s working, what’s not, and what to do next.**
